# RoadAccidentsPODS
Principles of Data Science coursework project investigating relationships between environmental conditions and traffic accidents in the UK.

* RoadSafety.py - Main data analysis script. Should run in any IDE, but was written in Spyder and contains cell breaks.
* refData.py - Script to run on the original data to convert reference data codes in to text values. The data in this repo is a product of this script (so it doesn't need to be run again).

* Environmental Conditions and Road Traffic Collisions in the UK v1.2.pdf - Project report.

* Acc_2016_Tidy.csv - All traffic accidents reported to police in 2016 involving injury.
